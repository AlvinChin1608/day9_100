# day9_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The bootcamp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner stage and later on intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.
